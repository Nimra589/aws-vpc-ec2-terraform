This repository contains Terraform code to provision a simple AWS infrastructure:

Custom VPC with a public subnet.

Internet Gateway and route configuration for public access.

Security group allowing SSH (22) and HTTP (80).

EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2 in the public subnet.

This setup is ideal for learning AWS networking and Terraform basics, or for use as a foundation for more complex architectures.
